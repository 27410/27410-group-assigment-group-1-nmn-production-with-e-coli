    "Revelant knowledge is one of the most important values for successfull investigations in science or fruitfull implementation of projects in industry. The huge availibility of data about *E.coli*, generetaded over the last centuries is alone an advantage over new discovered chassis. The reason, why *E.coli* became one of the most abundant studied organism so far was not the fact, that few strains are pathogenic to humans. Morelikely the facts, that *E. coli* is easily accessable, robust and fast growing on different kind of media made *E.coli* responsable for many groundbreaking discoveries like transcription, translation and replication. The ability of *E.coli* to grow in the abscence of oxygen makes the strain ecomical interesting.   \n",
    "The availibility of recent developments in systems biology, synthetic biology and evolutionary engineering within *E.coli*. makes the it the easiest way to increase the production of many chemicals and any metabolites. The usage of *E.coli*K-12 strain as an industrial chassis is already proven through many biotechnological applications. (Chen 2015)\n"

    "Escherichia coli K12 strains concerns heterologous protein production. For example, high acetate production and high protease activity inhibit production flux (Zhou, 2017). \n",
    "In particular, accumulated acetate decreases the growth and biomass concentration of E.coli (Lozano, 2019).\n",
